    <h2>Welcome to the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)</strong> is designed to streamline the process of submitting
        and approving monthly claims for <strong>Independent Contractor (IC) Lecturers</strong>. Our system transforms the
        traditional, time-consuming methods of managing claims into a seamless, efficient process that ensures
        accuracy, accountability, and transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
        At CMCS, we empower lecturers to submit detailed claims for their hours worked, which are reviewed thoroughly
        by both <strong>Programme Coordinators</strong> and <strong>Academic Managers</strong>. This ensures fair compensation
        while reducing administrative bottlenecks. Beyond claim submissions, the system offers powerful features such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Seamless uploading of supporting documents to enhance claim accuracy.</li>
        <li>Automated calculations based on hours worked and hourly rates.</li>
        <li>Real-time claim tracking for lecturers and approval managers.</li>
    </ul>
