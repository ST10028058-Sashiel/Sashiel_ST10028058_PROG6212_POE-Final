# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) - README

The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web-based application built using .NET Core and designed to streamline the submission, tracking, and approval of monthly claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. This system addresses the complexities often associated with claim management, providing an efficient, user-friendly platform for lecturers, coordinators, and managers. Through the CMCS, the entire process is automated, reducing manual work and administrative overhead while ensuring greater transparency and accountability. Each role within the system—lecturer, coordinator, and manager—has distinct functionalities that contribute to a smooth workflow, promoting accuracy and organizational efficiency.

Lecturers play a central role by creating and submitting claims that reflect the work they have performed. The CMCS allows them to enter essential claim details, such as the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. Each claim submission must be accompanied by a supporting document that serves as evidence for the work done. The system supports file formats such as Word documents, PDFs, and Excel spreadsheets. However, to maintain system efficiency, the uploaded file size must not exceed five megabytes. This file upload feature ensures that all submitted claims are well-documented and verifiable, reducing the risk of errors during the approval process. Once submitted, each claim is automatically marked as pending, awaiting review from the relevant coordinator or manager.

One of the primary benefits the CMCS offers to lecturers is the ability to track the status of their claims in real-time. After submission, lecturers can access a dedicated page where they can monitor whether their claims are still pending, have been approved, or have been rejected. This real-time feedback mechanism ensures transparency and keeps lecturers informed throughout the process. If a claim is approved, the lecturer sees it reflected on their dashboard. If the claim is rejected, the system provides feedback from the reviewer, explaining the reason for the rejection. This feedback mechanism helps lecturers understand any issues with their submission, allowing them to correct errors and resubmit claims efficiently.

In addition to tracking claim statuses, the CMCS allows lecturers to maintain a complete history of all their submitted claims. This feature is particularly useful for lecturers who submit multiple claims over time, as it enables them to view the details of past submissions and the corresponding outcomes. Having access to their submission history not only provides clarity but also helps lecturers plan their future claims. They can see which claims were approved and use the feedback from rejected claims to improve the quality of subsequent submissions. The CMCS places no limit on the number of claims a lecturer can submit, ensuring that users can document their work comprehensively, regardless of the number of engagements they manage.

Coordinators and managers play a critical role in the CMCS by reviewing the claims submitted by lecturers. Their primary responsibility is to assess the accuracy and completeness of the claims to ensure that the lecturers are compensated fairly. The system provides both coordinators and managers with access to all pending claims, which are organized chronologically by submission date. This organization helps reviewers prioritize their tasks and ensures that claims are processed promptly. Once a reviewer accesses a claim, they can examine the details provided by the lecturer, including the hours worked and the attached supporting document. Based on their evaluation, the reviewer can either approve the claim if all information is correct or reject it if there are issues that need to be addressed.

When a claim is approved, the status is updated within the system, and the lecturer is notified. This change is immediately reflected on the lecturer’s dashboard, indicating that the claim has been successfully processed. However, if the claim is rejected, the coordinator or manager provides a reason for the rejection within the system. This reason is visible to the lecturer, ensuring that there is transparency in the process. The feedback provided by the reviewer helps the lecturer understand the issues with the submission and guides them in making the necessary corrections. This iterative feedback process enhances the overall accuracy of the submissions and reduces the likelihood of repeated errors.

The CMCS ensures that the system functions efficiently by incorporating several technical features that support error handling and data integrity. File validation is a key component of the system, with rules in place to ensure that only supported file types are uploaded, and that files do not exceed the maximum size limit. This validation prevents system overloads and ensures that the uploaded documents meet the required standards. The system also employs role-based authentication, meaning that users only have access to the features relevant to their role. For example, lecturers can only create and track claims, while coordinators and managers have access to pending claims for review and approval. This security feature ensures that sensitive data is protected, and unauthorized users cannot access restricted parts of the system.

The CMCS offers a user-friendly interface tailored to the needs of each role. Lecturers access a streamlined form for submitting claims, complete with real-time validation to prevent common errors. They can also view their claims history and the status of current claims on dedicated pages. Coordinators and managers, on the other hand, have access to a dashboard displaying all pending claims, with options to approve or reject submissions. The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to perform their tasks efficiently without requiring extensive training. This simplicity ensures that all users can interact with the system effectively, promoting seamless collaboration between lecturers, coordinators, and managers.

The introduction of the CMCS has several key benefits for all stakeholders involved. For lecturers, the system reduces the time and effort required to submit claims, while providing them with transparency and control over their submissions. For coordinators and managers, the system simplifies the review process by organizing claims chronologically and providing essential details at a glance. The automated feedback mechanism ensures that lecturers receive timely information about the status of their claims, helping them correct issues quickly and resubmit when necessary. Overall, the system enhances organizational efficiency by automating routine tasks, reducing administrative workload, and promoting accountability at every step of the process.

In conclusion, the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a comprehensive solution for managing the submission and approval of monthly claims for Independent Contractor lecturers. It provides a seamless platform for collaboration between lecturers, coordinators, and managers, ensuring that claims are processed efficiently and transparently. With its user-centric design and robust functionality, the CMCS addresses the common challenges associated with claim management and offers a practical tool for improving administrative processes. Through this system, users not only experience the benefits of streamlined workflows but also develop a deeper understanding of best practices in modern software design and development.
